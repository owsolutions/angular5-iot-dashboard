<app-page-container maintitle="Restful API" subtitle="Understanding the Restful API and how to implement it">
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In order to display any information on your dashboard, you need to send your device information changes to our restful API.
  These apis, all require a token to distingush the identity.</p>

  <p>For more flexibilty, we can accept token per different device or a general token that can describe information for all devices,
  and in the request body, you can specifiy the device by it's id.
  Mostly our api sets are used to collect information but also you can find some apis that return you useful information about your ecosystem.</p>

  <p><b>It's very important to notice that</b> all responses from our server api are coming back with a guideline from google,
  called <i>google json styleguide</i> and you can guess success and failure of your api request based on this format.
  Generally speaking, if our servers be able to catch your request, we will return 200 response anyway, even if the operation
  has not performed. In this case you must look for error field within the response object.</p>
  
  <p>Response that are having 50x, 40x or else, are rarely appear because we aim to handle all possible situation with our api,
  and you must consider these kind of errors temporary out of service or partially downtime.</p>
