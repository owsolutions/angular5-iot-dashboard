<app-page-container maintitle="Welcome to realtime documentations" subtitle="In this section, we explain all about the dashboard usage and it's connectivity conditions to server, and how you can interact your hardwares using our REST api to make an interactive dashboard.">
  
  <h2>Basics and understanding</h2>
  <p>Here we are describing some basics about the dashboard and explain some definitions. You can connect your devices
    to <strong>esam.io</strong> dashboard for realtime monitoring, artificial intelligence, and reporting.
    We provide scalable and relaible platform for Iot devices which can be used for vast variety of purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Integrating devices and softwares</h2>
  <p>We are trying to provide couple of methods that gives developers this ability to conenct their devices to dashboard.
    These methods are consisting:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a routerLink="/docs/restful-api">RESTful api for biodirectional information, such as temperature devices</a></li>
    <li>UDP api for biodirectional information, such as temperature devices</li>
    <li>MQTT api, for multidirectional communications, such as sending information and recieving orders</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Note: </strong> <i>UDP and MQTT are still in experimental area, so they are not available in production and their
  api and domain access might change in near future.</i>

  
  <h2>Getting a token</h2>
  <p>You can find your <a routerLink="/token">Access Token</a> inside your settings section. Make sure you use the <a routerLink="/token">Access Token</a> only to update us for your device information,
  such as the changes in temperature or humidity, devices usages and etc. There might be other tokens provided to you
  and each have their own usage.
  Eversince you have your token, you can make post and get requests to the api server included <strong>x-token</strong> in headers.</p>

  <h2>CloudDevice vs DataSource</h2>
  <p>We have two definition in dashboard for data and devices which are really simple to understand and straightforward.</p>

  <p><b>CloudDevice</b> is a device that you can create in your management dashboard, in your Devices > Create a device. This device
  represents a phyical device or a part of that, and main purpose is to be used for human interactions, drawing charts and making reports.
  Each device, has a datasource. This datasource, is a raw data, such as a number for temperature that you send to api
  from your device. All devices must be connected to a datasource inorder to collect information.
  </p>
  <p>When you send your data with a data source id, we collect it, but if there is no device for this API we will show it in
    devices pages, as unconnected device. We are not subject to hold these information for long, if there is no device assigned.
    So it's necessary to create device based on device as quick as possible.

  </p>
  <p>You can connect a datasource to many devices only for biodirectional devices. We don't know why you might use this,
    but it's available in case of any usages.
  </p>
