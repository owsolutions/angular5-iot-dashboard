# Smart angular dashboard
IoT (Internet of Things) specific dashboard based on Angular 4. The goal of this repository is to be a resilience front-end for smart homes, smart offices, and industrial automation. 
**This project is heavily under development; In case you need to use some components in production level, please contact the owners**

# Features
This project has a decoupled data layer and view layer. 
The logic behind this app is connecting your physical devices to cloud, and make widgets based on their IO, and distribute between your locations.
We are covering user/role control access, and tracking activities. Since project is heavily under development, we are in doubt of our 
first stable version features yet.

## Technical stack

* Project is based on Angular 4 and angular CLI. For developing, we've added `npm run hmr` to provide hot reloading, but for production level we use `npm run production`, which calls `ng *` tasks directly.
* We are using highcharts library for our charts. For any incoming pull requests that containing other chart libraries, please open an issue first and describe why it's not possible to do it using highcharts.
* Lodash, and NgRx store are used heavily for data flow.
* Async/Await concepts are everywhere since project is a realtime dashboard
* Our TDD is karma ( default of the angular CLI ) and for CI, we use `TravisCI`. If you want to host the project on a private repository, you might want to 
write your CI specific configuration. We will cover CircleCI build in a near future.
* This project will produce only static files, project demo is hosted on the `Google firebase` but you can host the `dist` folder anywhere you want.
* We have a specific data flow, for catching data from server and posting back the user actions. Document for them currently missing, but you might check `requests.service` and `actions.service`
for this purpose.
